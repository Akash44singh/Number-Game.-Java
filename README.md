# Number-Game.-Java
This is a simple and interactive Number Guessing Game built using Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player gets 5 attempts to guess it correctly. The fewer attempts used, the higher the score. After each round, players can choose to play again, and their total score is tracked throughout the session.
